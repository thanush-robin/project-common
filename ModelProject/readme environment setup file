go to terminal 

create a folder through mkdir
mkdir ~/Thanush_relearned_project_v1
or create a folder and paste the  file their 

cd ~/Thanush_relearned_project_v1(your project folder name)


This will create and enter your new workspace.





Let’s create a new environment, for example called `nse_env_relearn`:

in Terminal 

conda create --name nse_env_relearn python=3.9.7

here on conda --name nse_env_relearn the above name was unique environment in conda
env so you can name it on your name own
```

Then activate it:

```
conda activate nse_env_relearn
```



1. Open VS Code.
2. Go to:

 
   File → Open Folder → Select `Thanush_relearned_project_v1(your project _name)
  
3. give cd ~ to open vs code terminal 

   conda activate nse_env_relearn
  
step 4: Set Interpreter to Python 3.9.7 (Conda)

1. Press:

   ```
   Ctrl + Shift + P
   ```
2. Type:

   ```
   Python: Select Interpreter
   ```
3. Choose:

   ```
   Python 3.9.7 (conda: nse_env_relearn)
   ```

If it doesn't show, click **"Enter interpreter path"** and paste this:

```bash
/home/tharun/anaconda3/envs/nse_env_relearn/bin/python
```
or 
in my case right bottom of vs code i seen the utf after that we can see the version of python 
this happens when you open python file in given code 
through if you click that on that python version you have chance to see and activate the interpreter

 STEP 5

If you already have a `requirements.txt`
on vs code terminal after step 4 you can do this install requirements 


pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install manually using:
