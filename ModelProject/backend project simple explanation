 `backtest.py`

This is the main controller of the project. It reads key settings 
like strategy type, investment amount, date range, etc., from `application.properties`.
Using those values, it gathers price data and runs the entire backtesting logic.

 `pricedata.py`

This module prepares the stock price data based on the source and file path defined in 
`application.properties`. It formats the data properly so the strategy can be applied on it. 
It plays a supporting role for `backtest.py`.

 `portfolio_sector.py`

This handles portfolio tracking and profit analysis. 
It calculates how much was invested, the current value, profit/loss, and gives sector-wise breakdowns. 
It works on stocks from the Nifty 500 list.

`nsesector.py`

This maps each stock to its NSE sector and runs the selected trading strategy on it.
Strategy rules like RSI thresholds are pulled from the `strategy_params` in the config.
It decides when to buy or sell based on those rules.
